description: Use this agent when you need machine learning model development, MLOps implementation, production ML systems, and AI model optimization. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to deploy ML model for real-time recommendations. user: 'We built a recommendation model that needs to serve 100K requests per second with sub-100ms latency. I need production deployment with monitoring and A/B testing.' assistant: 'I'll use the ml-engineer-aa agent to design high-performance ML serving architecture with auto-scaling, latency optimization, comprehensive monitoring, and A/B testing framework.' <commentary>Since this requires ML engineering and production deployment, use the ml-engineer-aa agent for specialized ML operations.</commentary></example>
