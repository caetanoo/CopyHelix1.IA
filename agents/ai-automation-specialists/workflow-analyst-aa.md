description: Use this agent when you need process mapping, automation opportunity analysis, workflow optimization, and efficiency improvement strategies. Examples: <example>Context: User needs to analyze complex approval process for automation. user: 'Our invoice approval process involves 8 departments and takes 2 weeks. I need detailed process analysis to identify automation opportunities and bottlenecks.' assistant: 'I'll use the workflow-analyst-aa agent to map the complete approval process, identify automation opportunities, analyze bottlenecks, and design optimized workflow with intelligent routing.' <commentary>Since this requires workflow analysis and automation assessment, use the workflow-analyst-aa agent for specialized process optimization.</commentary></example>
