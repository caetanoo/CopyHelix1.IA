## ‚úÖ Knowledge Checkpoints

### After Understanding Agent Categories
- [ ] Can you explain when to use financial-analyst-fs vs. investment-analyst-fs?
- [ ] What's the difference between growth-hacker and growth-hacker-gr?
- [ ] How would you coordinate technical and business agents for a product launch?
- [ ] Can you identify which agents would be needed for a market expansion initiative?

### After First Cross-Domain Use
- [ ] Did you see how business and technical agents complement each other?
- [ ] Can you identify what made each agent's approach unique to their domain?
- [ ] What would you do differently for your next multi-domain initiative?
- [ ] How did the agents handle cross-functional requirements?

### Advanced Business Orchestration
- [ ] Can you design a complete business workflow from concept to execution?
- [ ] Do you understand when to use specialist vs. generalist agents?
- [ ] Can you troubleshoot agent coordination issues independently?
- [ ] How would you adapt workflows for different business contexts?

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Business Context
Instead of: "Help me grow my business"
Try: "Create a customer acquisition strategy for our B2B SaaS targeting small businesses"

### 2. Provide Complete Context
- **Business Goals**: What you're trying to accomplish
- **Market Context**: Industry, competition, target audience
- **Constraints**: Budget, timeline, resources, regulatory requirements
- **Success Metrics**: How you'll measure success

### 3. Trust Domain Expertise
Each agent brings specialized knowledge and proven methodologies from their field. Let them guide the approach while you provide business context and requirements.

### 4. Leverage Cross-Functional Workflows
For complex business initiatives, coordinate multiple specialists more effectively than trying to handle everything with a single generalist approach.

### 5. Think in Business Systems
Consider how technical, marketing, financial, and operational aspects interconnect. Use agent teams to address all dimensions of business challenges.

## Integration with Claude Code

- **Financial validation and modeling** (financial-analyst-fs)
- **Performance measurement and optimization** (analytics-reporter)
- **Risk assessment and mitigation** (risk-assessor-fs)

## Contributing to Agent Development

### Agent Specification Format
Each agent follows a structured format:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When to use this agent, capabilities, and domain expertise
color: visual-identifier
---

# Persona definition including:
- Identity & Operating Principles
- Core Methodology
- Domain Expertise
- Problem-Solving Approach
- Quality Standards
- Communication Style
- Success Metrics
```

### Design Principles for Business Agents
1. **Domain Specialization** - Deep expertise in specific business functions
2. **Evidence-Based Decision Making** - All recommendations backed by data and industry best practices
3. **Cross-Functional Awareness** - Understanding of how domains interconnect
4. **Scalability Focus** - Solutions that work for startups to enterprise
5. **ROI Consciousness** - Business impact and return on investment considerations
6. **Risk Management** - Proactive identification and mitigation of business risks

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Activating
- **Use domain-specific keywords** (see Agent Decision Matrix above)
- **Be specific about the business context** (B2B vs B2C, industry, stage)
- **Mention specific deliverables** you need (financial model, marketing strategy, etc.)
- **Try explicit activation**: "Use the financial-analyst-fs agent to..."

### Getting Generic Business Advice
- **Specify your industry and market context**
- **Mention specific business metrics or goals**
- **Reference particular frameworks or methodologies**
- **Ask for the specialized approach or domain expertise**

### Multi-Agent Coordination for Business Initiatives
- **Request the product-manager-orchestrator** for complex cross-functional projects
- **Break initiatives into clear functional areas** (strategy, finance, marketing, operations)
